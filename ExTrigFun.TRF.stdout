Using the TRF algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 10 parameters will commence using a budget of 1024 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 512 queries
Search complete. Found 392 local minima in 23.57945942878723 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 512 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 37.7641314043
This is 3.68790345745 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 1024.0
Function classified as having uniformly scattered minima. Effective sphere search will commence away from the spheres.
Search complete. Found 244 local minima in 31.415074586868286 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 636 local minima in 54.99453401565552 seconds.
