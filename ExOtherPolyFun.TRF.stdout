Using the TRF algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 10 parameters will commence using a budget of 100 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 50 queries
Search complete. Found 48 local minima in 23.30673885345459 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 50 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 1.56746690411e+14
This is 26.5451896579 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 5.9049e+14
Function classified as having clustered minima. Effective sphere search will commence near the spheres.
Search complete. Found 49 local minima in 28.75007128715515 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 97 local minima in 52.05681014060974 seconds.
