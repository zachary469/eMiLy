Using the L-BFGS-B algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 2 parameters will commence using a budget of 30 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 15 queries
Search complete. Found 12 local minima in 0.040462493896484375 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 15 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 2.23210440497
This is 55.8026101243 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 4.0
Function classified as having clustered minima. Effective sphere search will commence near the spheres.
Search complete. Found 9 local minima in 0.18564486503601074 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 21 local minima in 0.22610735893249512 seconds.
