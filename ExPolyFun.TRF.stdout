Using the TRF algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 2 parameters will commence using a budget of 30 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 15 queries
Search complete. Found 11 local minima in 0.8759982585906982 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 15 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 1.66002143715
This is 41.5005359287 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 4.0
Function classified as having clustered minima. Effective sphere search will commence near the spheres.
Search complete. Found 10 local minima in 0.9316027164459229 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 21 local minima in 1.807600975036621 seconds.
