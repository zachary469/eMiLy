Using the L-BFGS-B algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 10 parameters will commence using a budget of 100 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 50 queries
Search complete. Found 49 local minima in 0.9993102550506592 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 50 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 4.86655405491e+13
This is 8.24155202443 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 5.9049e+14
Function classified as having uniformly scattered minima. Effective sphere search will commence away from the spheres.
Search complete. Found 49 local minima in 1.1185054779052734 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 98 local minima in 2.1178157329559326 seconds.
