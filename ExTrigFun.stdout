Minimum search of provided function with 10 parameters will commence using a budget of 1024 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 512 queries
Search complete. Found 400 local minima

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 512 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 0.969537016728
This is 0.0946813492898 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 1024.0
Function classified as having uniformly scattered minima. Effective sphere search will commence away from the spheres.
Search complete. Found 239 local minima
