Using the L-BFGS-B algorithm for local minimum searches.

Minimum search of provided function with 10 parameters will commence using a budget of 1024 minimum queries

Stage I. Initiating random search using 512 queries
Search complete. Found 399 local minima in 6.918565273284912 seconds

Stage II. Initiating active learning search relying on effective attraction spheres using 512 queries
Mean effective attraction volume around previously found local minima: 0.900804758532
This is 0.0879692147004 percent of the total parameter space, which itself has the volume: 1024.0
Function classified as having uniformly scattered minima. Effective sphere search will commence away from the spheres.
Search complete. Found 236 local minima in 15.040889978408813 seconds

Minimum search complete. Found a total of 635 local minima in 21.959455251693726 seconds.
